#Built-in Functions Test
#https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp/blob/master/09-Built-in%20Functions/08-Built-in%20Functions%20Assessment%20Test.ipynb
#For this test, you should use built-in functions and be able to write the requested functions in one line.

#Problem 4
#Use zip() and a list comprehension to return a list of the same length where each value is the two strings 
#from L1 and L2 concatenated together with connector between them. Look at the example output below:

def concatenate(L1, L2, connector):
    pass


concatenate(['A','B'],['a','b'],'-') # ['A-a', 'B-b']



#Problem 5
#Use enumerate() and other skills to return a dictionary which has the values of the list as keys and the index as the value. 
#You may assume that a value will only appear once in the given list.

def d_list(L):
    pass
        
d_list(['a','b','c']) # {('A', '-', 'a')}





####Object Oriented Programming Challenge
#For this challenge, create a bank account class that has two attributes:
#owner balance and two methods: deposit withdraw
#As an added requirement, withdrawals may not exceed the available balance.
# Instantiate your class, make several deposits and withdrawals, and test to make sure the account can't be overdrawn.




#Project1 Tic-Tac-Toe: 
#Considering I made a tic-tac-toe game in JavaScript a few years ago:
#https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/FreeCodeCamp/blob/master/tic-tac-toe
#I was shocked at how challenging this project was. I had to occasionally look at solutions manual which was disapointing,
#So I should probably reattempt this project at a later date. 




Possible Issues:
#Problem 2
#Use reduce() to take a list of digits and return the number that they correspond to. For example, [1, 2, 3] corresponds
#to one-hundred-twenty-three. Do not convert the integers to strings!

#So using reduce is frowned upon, rarely used, and is even being considered getting removed: 
#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/181543/what-is-the-problem-with-reduce
#Therefore, after using initial solution using str_sum I did not spend much more time on this problem.
