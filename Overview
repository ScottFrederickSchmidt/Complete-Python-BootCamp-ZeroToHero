#These following problems need to be attempted again:


#Built-in Functions Test
#https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp/blob/master/09-Built-in%20Functions/08-Built-in%20Functions%20Assessment%20Test.ipynb
#For this test, you should use built-in functions and be able to write the requested functions in one line.

#Problem 4
#Use zip() and a list comprehension to return a list of the same length where each value is the two strings 
#from L1 and L2 concatenated together with connector between them. Look at the example output below:

def concatenate(L1, L2, connector):
    pass


concatenate(['A','B'],['a','b'],'-') # ['A-a', 'B-b']



#Problem 5
#Use enumerate() and other skills to return a dictionary which has the values of the list as keys and the index as the value. 
#You may assume that a value will only appear once in the given list.

def d_list(L):
    pass
        
d_list(['a','b','c']) # {('A', '-', 'a')}
