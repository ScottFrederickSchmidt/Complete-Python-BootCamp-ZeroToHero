#Some of these I have already completed such as the five below. So intead, I am moving onto the Datascience Bootcamp:

#1)Fibonacci Sequence-Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.
#https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/Project-Euler/blob/master/Problem%202

#2)Prime Factorization - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.
#https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/Project-Euler/blob/master/Problem%203

#3)Collatz Conjecture - Start with a number n > 1. Find the number of steps it takes to reach one using the following process: 
#If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1
#https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/Project-Euler/blob/master/Problem14

#4)Fetch Current Weather - Get the current weather for a given zip/postal code. Optional: Try locating the user automatically.

#Fizz Buzz - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” 
#instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. 
#For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

for i in range(101):
    if i %3==0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif i %5==0:
        print("Buzz")
    elif i%5==0 and i%3==0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    else:
        print(i)

#Reverse a String - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.
def reverse(string):
    backwards=string[::-1]
    return backwards
reverse("hello")
